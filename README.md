## Introduction
Hello ladies & gents!  

This project was built with NodeJS + Express. So, safe to say you will need Node/npm installed.  

To start, please first run ```npm install``` to install dependencies.  
In the main directory, run ```node index.js``` and the server will start on port 3000. A message "Listening on port 3000!" should appear, indicating the server is live.

Navigate to localhost:3000 and use any of the available routes:  
```/products```  
```/product/:id```  
```/store/inventory```

I thought I would've had more time to tackle the bonuses, but alas, this assessment was a doozy.

Thank you for your time!
